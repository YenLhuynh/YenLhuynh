Hi, I'm Yen Huynh. 
I graduated from University of Washington with Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics.
My hobby is researching and building keyboards. I got to build two keyboards that sound amazing and affordable.  

I'm exploring Github and how I can integrate Github with SQL. In the future, I hope that I can use my creativity in designning data structure with more efficient for customers or users. :bulb:
